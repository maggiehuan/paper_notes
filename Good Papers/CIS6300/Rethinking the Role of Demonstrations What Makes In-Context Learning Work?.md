ICL - perform a new task via inference along by conditioning on a new input-label pairs (demonstrations). 
- ground truth demonstrations are not required - randomly replacing labels in the demonstrations don't hurt performance
but they provide:
- the label space
- the distribution of the input text
- overall format of the sequence
which part of demonstrations do contribute to the performance
label space and distribution of the input text specified by the demonstrations are both key to ICL, the overall formate is also crucial.
