Question: whether a skilled decision-maker plan more steps ahead. -> use model fitting to show that human behavior can be captured using heuristic search. 
- Validation: 
	- Predict human choices, response times, eye movements
	- Turing test
	- Reconstructed experiments (what is this?)
- Result:
	- Increased planning depth with expertise
	- Experts **memorize and reconstruct board features** more accurately

Human planning: goal-directed decision-making -> plan along multiple branches in a decision-tree -> eliminate unpromising branches by pruning.
- Human behavior consistent with planning several steps into the future.
- Human use prospective info to guide current choices, locate the representation of prospective info to cingulate and prefrontal cortices.
