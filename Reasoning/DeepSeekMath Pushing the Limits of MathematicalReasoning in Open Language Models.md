Interesting notes:
""
DeepSeekMath-Base is initialized with DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B (Guo et al., 2024), as we notice that starting from a code training model is a better choice compared to a general LLM. Furthermore, we observe the math training also improves model capability on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and BBH benchmarks (Suzgun et al., 2022), indicating it does not only enhance the modelâ€™s mathematical abilities but also amplifies general reasoning capabilities.
